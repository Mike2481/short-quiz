# short-quiz

This challenge was to create a short coding quiz with timer and high score generation.  High scores are stored in local storage, so they stick around until bested.

## End Result

In the end, I was able to create a functioning quiz with all the required features.  The site being fully responsive was not a requirement, but I think it's something I'll add later on.  The quiz does have a timer that will stop the quiz when it reaches zero, and will reduce by ten seconds every time a wrong answer is given.  Each answer selected is given a response of either correct or wrong so the user knows now they did.  All scores are stored in local storage and the best score is displayed in the top corner.

## Challenges

This quiz had it's fair share of challenges.  The high score feature was especially challenging for me to get ironed out.  In the end, I was able to get the scores to store and display, but unable to get the users initials to display properly.
